## About

`create-bts` is a shorter alias for the full `create-better-t-stack` command. Both packages provide the same functionality - a modern CLI tool for scaffolding end-to-end type-safe TypeScript projects.

All functionality is provided by the main [`create-better-t-stack`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-better-t-stack) package.
