## Adding More Features

You can add additional addons or deployment options to your project using:

{{#if (eq packageManager "bun")}}bunx{{else if (eq packageManager "pnpm")}}pnpx{{else}}npx{{/if}} create-better-t-stack
add
```

Available addons you can add:
- **Documentation**: Starlight, Fumadocs
- **Linting**: Biome, Oxlint, Ultracite
- **Other**: vibe-rules, Turborepo, PWA, Tauri, Husky

## Project Configuration

This project includes a `bts.jsonc` configuration file that stores your Better-T-Stack settings:

- Contains your selected stack configuration (database, ORM, backend, frontend, etc.)
- Used by the CLI to understand your project structure
- Safe to delete if not needed
- Updated automatically when using the `add` command

## Key Points

- This is a {{#if (includes addons "turborepo")}}Turborepo {{/if}}monorepo using {{packageManager}} workspaces
- Each app has its own `package.json` and dependencies
- Run commands from the root to execute across all workspaces
- Run workspace-specific commands with `{{packageManager}} run command-name`
{{#if (includes addons "turborepo")}}
- Turborepo handles build caching and parallel execution
{{/if}}
- Use `{{#if (eq packageManager "bun")}}bunx{{else if (eq packageManager "pnpm")}}pnpx{{else}}npx{{/if}}
