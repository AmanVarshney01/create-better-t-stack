### Server-based projects

<Files>
  <Folder name="apps" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="server" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="src" />
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="web" defaultOpen disabled>
      <Folder name="src" />
      <Folder name="public" />
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="native" defaultOpen disabled>
      <Folder name="app" />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>

Notes:
- `apps/server` is present for backends like `hono`, `express`, `fastify`, `elysia`, `next`.
- `apps/web` and `apps/native` are optional; they appear only if you select a web or native frontend.

### Convex-based projects

<Files>
  <Folder name="apps" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="web" defaultOpen disabled>
      <Folder name="src" />
      <Folder name="public" />
    </Folder>
    <Folder name="native" defaultOpen disabled>
      <Folder name="app" />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
  <Folder name="packages" defaultOpen>
    <Folder name="backend" defaultOpen>
      <Folder name="convex" />
    </Folder>
  </Folder>
</Files>

Notes:
- Convex replaces the server app; `packages/backend` is generated instead of `apps/server`.
- Auth, DB/ORM, and API scaffolding are disabled for Convex presets.

### Where features land (high level)

- API layer: merged into `apps/server` and `apps/web` when applicable.
- Database & ORM: merged into `apps/server` when both are selected.
- Authentication: merged into `apps/server`, `apps/web`, and `apps/native` when enabled and compatible.
- Addons: PWA merges into `apps/web`; others merge at the appropriate location.
- Web deployment (Workers): deployment files merge into `apps/web` per frontend.
- Runtime extras (Workers): Workers-specific files added at the repo root.
