## Overview

The CLI uses `@clack/prompts` for interactive questions. These prompts work well in most terminals and are fully keyboard-driven.

## Core keys

- **Navigate**: Up/Down arrow keys
- **Confirm/continue**: Enter
- **Cancel**: Ctrl+C

## Prompt types youâ€™ll see

### Single select (choose one)

- **Move** with Up/Down, **Enter** to choose the highlighted option.

Typical places: choosing a web or native framework, picking a runtime or API.

### Multi-select (choose many)

- **Move** with Up/Down.
- **Space** toggles the highlighted option on/off.
- **Enter** confirms your selection(s).
- Some prompts allow selecting none (you can press Enter without toggling anything).

Typical places: selecting project types (web/native), choosing example apps.

### Grouped multi-select (addons)

- Options are organized under group headings.
- **Move** with Up/Down, **Space** to toggle an option, **Enter** to confirm.
- Group headings are informational; toggle the items within groups.

Used when selecting addons like Biome, PWA, Turborepo, etc.

### Confirm (yes/no)

- Use Left/Right or Up/Down to highlight Yes/No, then **Enter**.

Typical places: installing dependencies, initializing Git.

### Text input

- Type your answer and press **Enter**.
- If validation fails, a short message will explain what to fix; edit and press **Enter** again.

Typical places: project name/path, database URLs, provider-specific inputs.

## Tips

- You can skip all prompts with `--yes` if you want the defaults. See the [Options](/docs/cli/options#yes--y) page.
- If you accidentally start the wrong flow, press **Ctrl+C** to cancel safely.
