title: Analytics & Telemetry
description: What we collect, how to disable it, and where to view aggregated insights

## What is collected

On successful project creation, the CLI sends a single event (`project_created`) with:

- Selected options (stack choices), including: `frontend`, `backend`, `runtime`, `database`, `orm`, `api`, `auth`, `payments`, `addons`, `examples`, `dbSetup`, `webDeploy`, `serverDeploy`, `packageManager`, `git`, `install`
- Environment data: `cli_version`, `node_version`, `platform`

Not collected:

- Project name, path, or file contents (explicitly omitted)
- Secrets or environment variables from your machine

## Disable telemetry

Telemetry is enabled by default. To disable:

```bash
BTS_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1 npx create-better-t-stack@latest
```

<Callout title="Note">The above command disables it for a single run.</Callout>

Add `export BTS_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` to your shell profile to make it permanent.

## Where to view analytics

- Charts: [`/analytics`](/analytics)
- Shared website analytics: [Umami dashboard](https://umami.amanv.cloud/share/pHvqHleyOl9PBfaK) (self-hosted on a Hostinger VPS)
- Raw JSON snapshot: `https://r2.better-t-stack.dev/analytics-data.json`
- CSV export: `https://r2.better-t-stack.dev/export.csv`

Notes:

- Aggregates are periodically regenerated from incoming events
- Raw data is not publicly exposed; the `/analytics` page presents only summary statistics

## Full transparency

Single event per scaffold; no IP or project identifiers. See source code below.

If in doubt, set `BTS_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` and proceed. You can still use all CLI features.
