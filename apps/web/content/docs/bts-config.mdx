description: What bts.jsonc does and why it matters
---

## What is it?

`bts.jsonc` is a small config file written to your project root when you create a project. It captures the stack choices you selected (frontend, backend, API, DB/ORM, auth, addons, etc.). The file uses JSONC (JSON with comments) and includes a schema for editor hints.

Where: `./bts.jsonc`

## Why it exists

- Required for the `add` command to detect your current stack
- Helps validate compatibility and pre‑fill sensible defaults

If `bts.jsonc` is missing, the `add` command cannot run because the project cannot be detected.

## Safe to delete (with a caveat)

It’s safe to delete for normal development; the generated code in `apps/*` and `packages/*` remains the source of truth. However, if you plan to use the `add` command later, you must keep `bts.jsonc` (or recreate it) so the CLI can detect your project.

## Format

The file is JSONC with comments enabled and includes a `$schema` URL for tooling.

```jsonc
// Better-T-Stack configuration file
// safe to delete
{
  "$schema": "https://r2.better-t-stack.dev/schema.json",
  "version": "x.y.z",
  "createdAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z",
  "frontend": ["tanstack-router"],
  "backend": "hono",
  "runtime": "bun",
  "database": "sqlite",
  "orm": "drizzle",
  "api": "trpc",
  "auth": true,
  "addons": ["turborepo"],
  "examples": [],
  "dbSetup": "none",
  "webDeploy": "none",
  "packageManager": "bun"
}
```

Notes:
- Values mirror what you selected during project creation
- The file may be updated when you run `add` (e.g., addons or webDeploy)
