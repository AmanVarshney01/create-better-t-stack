## General

### What is Better‑T‑Stack?
An opinionated CLI that scaffolds full‑stack TypeScript projects (frontend, backend, API, DB/ORM, auth, addons) with a clean monorepo. See the Quick Start on the docs home.

### Do I need to install anything globally?
No. Run the CLI directly with your package manager. See Quick Start and the per‑command pages under CLI.

### Which package manager can I use?
`npm`, `pnpm`, or `bun` (all supported).

### What Node.js version is required?
Node.js 18+ (LTS recommended).

### Can I use this with an existing project?
The CLI is for new projects. You can migrate gradually or use `add` to extend a Better‑T‑Stack project.

### Where do generated files live?
See Project Structure for high‑level layouts (server‑based vs. Convex, optional web/native).

## Choosing options

### Does the CLI recommend a stack?
No. Pick what fits your needs. The CLI validates compatibility. See CLI (per command) and Compatibility for rules.

### I’m unsure between tRPC and oRPC / Drizzle and Prisma
See Compatibility for guidance and constraints. Both pairs work well; choose based on team and hosting needs.

## Common issues

### My mobile app can’t connect to the backend (Expo)
Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` in `apps/native/.env` to your machine IP (not `localhost`), check firewall, or try `npx expo start --tunnel`.

### How do I disable telemetry?
Set `BTS_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` (shell env). For one run, prefix the command; to make it permanent, export it in your shell profile.
