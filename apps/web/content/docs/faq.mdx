## General

<Accordions type="single">
  <Accordion
    id="faq-1"
    title="What is Better‑T‑Stack?">
    An opinionated CLI that scaffolds full‑stack TypeScript projects (frontend, backend, API, DB/ORM, auth, addons) with a clean monorepo. See the Quick Start on the docs home.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion 
    id="faq-2"
    title="Do I need to install anything globally?">
    No. Run the CLI directly with your package manager. See Quick Start and the per‑command pages under CLI.
  </Accordion>

 <Accordion 
    id="faq-3"
    title="Which package manager can I use?">
    `npm`, `pnpm`, or `bun` (all supported).
 </Accordion>

 <Accordion 
    id="faq-4"
    title="What Node.js version is required?">
    Node.js 20+ (LTS recommended).
 </Accordion>

 <Accordion 
    id="faq-5"
    title="Can I use this with an existing project?">
    The CLI is for new projects. You can migrate gradually or use `add` to extend a Better‑T‑Stack project.
 </Accordion>

 <Accordion 
    id="faq-6"
    title="Where do generated files live?">
    See Project Structure for high‑level layouts (server‑based vs. Convex, optional web/native)..
 </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Choosing options

<Accordions type="single">
 <Accordion 
    id="faq-7"
    title="Does the CLI recommend a stack?">
    No. Pick what fits your needs. The CLI validates compatibility. See CLI (per command) and Compatibility for rules.
 </Accordion>

 <Accordion 
    id="faq-8"
    title="I’m unsure between tRPC and oRPC / Drizzle and Prisma">
    See Compatibility for guidance and constraints. Both pairs work well; choose based on team and hosting needs.
 </Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Common issues

<Accordions type="single">
 <Accordion 
    id="faq-9"
    title="My mobile app can’t connect to the backend (Expo)">
    Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` in `apps/native/.env` to your machine IP (not `localhost`), check firewall, or try `npx expo start --tunnel`.
 </Accordion>

 <Accordion 
    id="faq-10"
    title="How do I disable telemetry?">
    Set `BTS_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` (shell env). For one run, prefix the command; to make it permanent, export it in your shell profile.
 </Accordion>
</Accordions>
